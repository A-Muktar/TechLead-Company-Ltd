                    Protocols are the rules that specify how messages should be
                    formatted and how responses should be generated.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    Protocols are important in programming because they allow
                    devices to communicate with each other.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    In order for two devices to communicate, they need to be
                    using the same protocol, the same way that two humans
                    can&#x27;t understand each other unless they communicate
                    with a shared language.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    There are many different protocols that can be used, and
                    each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and each has
                    been heavily influenced by the technology available at the
                    time it was started.

                  <p>
                    Some common protocols used in programming include TCP/IP,
                    HTTP / HTTPS, and SMTP. Lets learn a bit about the purpose
                    and inner-workings of each of these more-common protocols.

                  <p>
                    The TCP/IP protocol stack is a set of protocols that are
                    used to communicate over the internet.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    The stack consists of four layers: the physical layer, the
                    data link layer, the network layer, and the transport layer.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    Each layer has its own set of protocols that are responsible
                    for different tasks.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    The physical layer handles communication between devices,
                    the data link layer handles communication between nodes, the
                    network layer handles routing of packets, and the transport
                    layer handles end-to-end communication.

                    Historically, HTTP is the protocol used to fetch web pages,
                    while HTTPS is used for secure communications, such as
                    online banking or shopping.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    But most modern websites use HTTPS to serve traffic on all
                    web pages to ensure all websites are as secure as possible.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    Both HTTP and HTTPS use the same underlying technology, but
                    HTTPS adds an extra layer of security by encrypting data
                    before it is transmitted.

                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    When you visit a website, your browser will automatically
                    use whichever protocol is supported by the site (usually
                    HTTPS).

                    However, you can force your browser to use HTTP if
                    you&#x27;re visiting an older website. Some websites offer
                    both HTTP and HTTPS versions, while others only offer one or
                    the other.

                    SMTP is a text-based protocol that uses plain text to send
                    messages (such as email), and is what&#x27;s called a push
                    protocol, which means that it sends messages from one server
                    to another.
                  </p>
                  <!-- -->
                  <p>
                    SMTP is also referred to as a store-and-forward protocol,
                    which means that it stores messages on the sending server
                    until they can be delivered to the receiving server.

                    &quot;client-server protocol&quot;, which means that an FTP
                    client program (running on your computer) is used to connect
                    to an FTP server program (running on the remote computer.)

                  <!-- -->

                    As we discussed, protocols are different sets of rules and

                    currencies started in the early 2020&#x27;s created their
                    own protocols.)

              "content": "## Introduction to protocols\n\nProtocols are the rules that specify how messages should be formatted and how responses should be generated.\n\nProtocols are important in programming because they allow devices to communicate with each other.\n\nIn order for two devices to communicate, they need to be using the same protocol, the same way that two humans can't understand each other unless they communicate with a shared language.\n\nThere are many different protocols that can be used, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and each has been heavily influenced by the technology available at the time it was started.\n\nSome common protocols used in programming include TCP/IP, HTTP / HTTPS, and SMTP.  Lets learn a bit about the purpose and inner-workings of each of these more-common protocols.\n\n## The TCP/IP protocol stack\n\nThe TCP/IP protocol stack is a set of protocols that are used to communicate over the internet.\n\nThe stack consists of four layers: the physical layer, the data link layer, the network layer, and the transport layer.\n\nEach layer has its own set of protocols that are responsible for different tasks.\n\nThe physical layer handles communication between devices, the data link layer handles communication between nodes, the network layer handles routing of packets, and the transport layer handles end-to-end communication.\n\n## HTTP and HTTPS protocols\n\nHistorically, HTTP is the protocol used to fetch web pages, while HTTPS is used for secure communications, such as online banking or shopping.\n\nBut most modern websites use HTTPS to serve traffic on all web pages to ensure all websites are as secure as possible.\n\nBoth HTTP and HTTPS use the same underlying technology, but HTTPS adds an extra layer of security by encrypting data before it is transmitted.\n\nWhen you visit a website, your browser will automatically use whichever protocol is supported by the site (usually HTTPS).\n\nHowever, you can force your browser to use HTTP if you're visiting an older website. Some websites offer both HTTP and HTTPS versions, while others only offer one or the other.\n\n## SMTP protocol\n\nSMTP is a text-based protocol that uses plain text to send messages (such as email), and is what's called a push protocol, which means that it sends messages from one server to another.\n\nSMTP is also referred to as a store-and-forward protocol, which means that it stores messages on the sending server until they can be delivered to the receiving server.\n\nAnd SMTP is a \"reliable protocol,\" which means that delivery of messages is guaranteed.\n\n## FTP protocol\n\nFTP is a standard protocol for transferring files between computers on the Internet, and it's a \"client-server protocol\", which means that an FTP client program (running on your computer) is used to connect to an FTP server program (running on the remote computer.)\n\nOnce connected, you can upload or download files from the server using the FTP client.\n\nTo connect to an FTP server, you need the server's hostname or IP address, as well as a username and password (if the server requires authentication.)\n\nThere are many different FTP clients available; some are free, while others must be purchased.\n\n## Other protocols\n\nAs we discussed, protocols are different sets of rules and standards that govern how computer code works, and there's a near-infinite number of them.\n\nSome were created decades ago, while many others were created just within the last year or two (many of the crypto currencies started in the early 2020's created their own protocols.)\n\nProtocols are constantly evolving, so it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest changes.",

                "content": "FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is a program that allows you to transfer files from your computer to your online area (and vice versa).\n\nThere are many FTP programs available. Some are free, some are not. A couple of the most popular ones are... SmartFTP and WS_FTP.\n\nOnce you have downloaded an FTP program, start it up. The usual information it asks for is:\n* Host ftp URL\n* Your username\n* Your password\n\nThose values should be supplied by your host when you started using them.\n\nAfter those values are entered, you can click on the CONNECT icon. This will now connect your computer to your online area.\n\nThe FTP program will have 2 windows showing. One is your computer, the other is the online area. Find the correct directory and file you want to transfer on your local computer window. Click or highlight the file. Find the correct directory where the file is going to be uploaded to online. Many hosts have the \"root\" directory named **public_html** or **www** or **httpdocs**. Once those are set, click on the -\u003e icon or click-on-and-drag the file over to the right spot. You have now transferred a file!",
